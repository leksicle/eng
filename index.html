            [Verse: Lois Griffin]
            It seems today that all you see
            Is violence in movies and gex on TV
            
            [Bridge: Peter Griffin]
            But where are those good old-fashioned values...
            
            [Bridge: The Griffins]
            On which we used to rely?!
            
            [Chorus: All]
            Lucky there's a family guy!
            Lucky there's a man who
            Positively can do
            All the things that make us...
            
            [Fill: Stewie Griffin]
            Laugh and cry!
            
            [Outro: All]
            He's our Family Guy!
